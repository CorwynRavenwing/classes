        # okay dude, I tried Sieve of Eratosthenes,
        # and it timed out.  Fair enough.  So then
        # I tried Dijkstra's algorithm and it timed out too.
        # Then read your "hints" and saw that it said
        # I should try Sieve of Eratosthenes, which is
        # known to be much slower, but whatever.
        # So I did another version of that one and it's still too slow.
        # I did it as a list, I did it as a stack of filters
        # and I cut off at P^2 > n.  It still times out.
        # This problem is ridiculous.
        # UPDATE:
        # also, when problems time out, and I click "Use Testcase",
        # for some reason they usually DO NOT time out when I run them.
        # Only when I click "submit".  Why TF do the Run and Submit
        # systems not have the same timeout?  How are we supposed
        # to fix our problems if the test and production environments
        # act completely differently?
